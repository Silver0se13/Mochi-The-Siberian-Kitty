    text.innerHTML = "Mochi is a cute and gorgeous little Siberian kitty. She has beautiful blue eyes and the fluffiest fur. Mochi's little nose is both pink and black, which her human mama thinks is unique. This kitty is very curious by nature but does get scared of loud noises (like the vacuum and hair dryer). She's playful and loves cuddling up to her human mama. Mochi is very affectionate towards people she trusts. She's super sweet and hardly ever bites or scratches, only giving love bites. This little kitty is known for how much she purrs and how loud her purrs are. A pretty cool fact is that her birth parents are both pretty awesome, having won titles in official cat shows!"

    text.innerHTML = "Mochi was so small and super curious! She was also very shy and quiet, rarely meowing. The moment her carrier was opened, she took small, cautious steps in and out of her new home. You could see her nose working, taking in all the new scents. Mochi quickly got busy playing with all her new toys. She ended up wearing herself out and took a relaxed, comfortable nap. This little kitty spent the whole day and night near her new human mama, feeling comfortable enough to cuddle up to her! These first couple of days were exciting for both of them."

Mochi slowly started harness training so she could enjoy outdoor walks from time to time. This kitty quickly got used to a harness and leash, and before she knew it, she was out exploring the front and back yard! Her fur pattern had started coming in more, with her paws and face beginning to darken. During this time, Mochi also visited the vet for her vaccines, and she surprisingly handled it very well! In fact, she was purring while they gave her the shot. She was just too busy eating a treat."

Her fur color is a lot darker now, especially on her face. Some parts of Mochi's white fur now have a creamish hue. Her tail is really fluffy now too. Mochi is very clever. She's learned little tricks and games like 'peek-a-boo', 'fetch', and 'sit'. This little kitty understands words like 'good night' and 'bye-bye', and usually comes when called. Mochi has also become a lot more vocal, meowing more often. She's still quiet most of the time, but she no longer hesitates when she wants attention. This little kitty is growing beautifully."
